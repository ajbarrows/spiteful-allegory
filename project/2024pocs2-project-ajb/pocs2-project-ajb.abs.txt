It is important, in any scientific discourse, to determine the state of the field. This is particularly true for the field of neuroimaging, which currently contends with a crisis of reproducibility. Recent advances in text-based analysis allow for efficient semi-supervised topic extraction from large databases of scientific articles. The present work implements a semi-supervised technique for extracting methods-related terms from a corpus of scientific abstracts in the Neuosynth database and summarizes relevant topics using probabilistic (LDA) and embedding-based (BERTopic) topic models. The utility of this approach is reflected in an interpretable set of topics which begin to characterize fundamental changes in neuroimaging research between 1997 and 2018. Results demonstrate the impressive utility of embedding-based models for short text snippets. Suggested implementations and directions for future research are discussed.
