%% pride and prejudice

\textbf{Three stories to analyze:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Pride and Prejudice}\\
  \url{https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342}
\item
  \textbf{Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus}\\

\item
  \textbf{Moby Dick; Or, The Whale}\\

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tasks:}

\fbox{\begin{minipage}{40em}
		Code  is available at \href{https://github.com/ajbarrows/spiteful-allegory}{https://github.com/ajbarrows/spiteful-allegory}.
		
		See \texttt{/work/notebooks}
\end{minipage}}


\begin{enumerate}
\item (9 points, 3 points for each novel)

  Take the UTF-8 text versions of each of these three novels
  and parse them into narrative time series of 1-grams
  which include all punctuation, numbers, and words.

  See below for instructions.

  For each novel,
  present your output for the first paragraph, rendered as a single, wrapped line.

\textbf{Pride and Prejudice}

\fbox{
	\begin{minipage}{30em}
It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife . However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters . “ My dear Mr. Bennet , ” said his lady to him one day , “ have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ”
	\end{minipage}
}


\textbf{Frankenstein}

	\fbox{
	\begin{minipage}{30em}
	You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings . I arrived here yesterday , and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking .
	\end{minipage}
}

\textbf{Moby Dick}

\fbox{
	\begin{minipage}{30em}
		Call me Ishmael . Some years agoever mind how long preciselyaving little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world . It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation . Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people’s hats offhen , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can . This is my substitute for pistol and ball . With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship . There is nothing surprising in this . If they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .

\item (9 points, 3 points for each novel)

  For each novel, produce size rank distributions of 1-grams according to counts.

  Display the 1-grams and counts for the first 100 1-grams.

My counts are reasonably close to the examples, which I attribute to a difference in manually removing material. Or some other thing. 


\item (9 points, 3 points for each novel)

  For each novel, plot the rank-count distribution for 1-grams.

\textbf{Outputs provided for comparison:}

The basic data format is as a time series with one 1-gram per line (links below).

For each story, also linked to below are the rank distributions of 1-grams by counts.

\textbf{General instructions:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Using an editor, remove the start and finish material
  for each of the three novels that Gutenberg adds to books
  somewhat inconsistently.
\item
  Using a judicious selection of regex operations,
  create a script (Python is strongly recommended but you can use whatever you like)
  to break up the text into meaningful 1-grams that
  may be words, punctuation, and numbers.

  Regex = \wordwikilink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular\_expression}{Regular Expression.}
\item
  See Perl code below for an example.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    ## for Frankenstein
    $text =~ s/D--n/Damn/g;

    ## separate out some basic punctuation
    $text =~ s/([\!\?\,\.])/ \1 /g;
    $text =~ s/:/ : /g; 
    $text =~ s/;/ \; /g;

    ## remove underscores used for emphasis
    $text =~ s/_//g; 

    ## isolate parentheses
    $text =~ s/\(/ ( /g;
    $text =~ s/\)/ ) /g;

    ## dash madness    
    $text =~ s/----/ --- /g; ## long dash
    $text =~ s/--/ --- /g; ## em dash
    $text =~ s/;—/ --- /g; ## em dash
    $text =~ s/—/ --- /g; ## em dash

    ## handle specific salutations
    $text =~ s/Mr \./Mr./g;
    $text =~ s/Mrs \./Mrs./g;
    $text =~ s/Dr \./Dr./g;

    ## clean up white space duplication
    $text =~ s/\s+/ /g;

    ## separate quotes
    ## opening quotes should have a space before them (except for em dashes, treated above)
    $text =~ s/\s"/ " /g;
    ## closing quotes should be what's left:
    $text =~ s/"/ " /g;
    $text =~ s/“/ “ /g;
    $text =~ s/”/ ” /g;

    ## separate off opening single quotation mark
    $text =~ s/‘/ ‘ /g;

    ## dyspunctional catapostrophes:
    ## clean up apostrophes and opening and closing single quote mark
    ## closing single quote mark should generally be isolated
    ## leave alone to preserve contractions
    $text =~ s/‘/ ' /g;

    $text =~ s/’/'/g;
    ## opening quote mark
    ## \p{L} stands for any UTF-8 letter
    $text =~ s/(\s)'(\p{L})/\1' \2/g;
    ## closing quote mark (will be a problem with contractions)
    $text =~ s/(\p{L})'(\s)/\1 '\2/g;
    
    ## split off possession indicator
    $text =~ s/'s/ 's/g;

    ## remove any white space at the front
    $text =~ s/^\s+//;

    ## add new line at the end
    $text = $text."\n";

    ## now create time series text by replacing spaces with returns
    ($timeseriestext = $text) =~ s/ /\n/g;
    
    ## last: remove any white space redundancies
    $timeseriestext =~ s/\s+/\n/ms;
