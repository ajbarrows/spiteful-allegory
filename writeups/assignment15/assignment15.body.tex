\begin{enumerate}

\item

  Continue to explore the emotional content of Pride and Prejudice, Frankenstein, and Moby Dick.

  Task: Compute emotional arcs by sliding a window of width $T$ 1-grams through each book
  as described below.

  
  Reminder: The labMT word list was published with Ref.~\cite{dodds2011e} in 2011, and
  has been occasionally upgraded when necessary to accommodate changes in language use.
  
  See \wordwikilink{https://hedonometer.org}{https://hedonometer.org}
  and
  \wordwikilink{https://storywrangling.org}{https://storywrangling.org}
  for the current version.


  \begin{enumerate}
%%   \item
%%     Done: Process (destroy) your text so that it is a simple text file with one 1-gram per line---a vector of 1-grams.
%% 
%%     To the extent possible, keep punctuation in as separate 1-grams. Periods, commas, semicolons, em dashes, ellipses, \ldots
%% 
%%     You can submit this is a separate file, but okay to just say you've succeeded.
  \item (3$\times$3 = 9)
    First use the full lexical lens provided by labMT ($\delta \havgfn = 0$).


    Make a single figure containing a stacked set of 7 plots with text windows of size $T = [10^{\mu}]$
    for $\mu$ = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4.0.

    Stacked here means separated and stacked vertically, as opposed to directly overlaid.
    See examples for Moby Dick at the end of this assignment.

    The notation $[ \cdot ]$ means round to the nearest integer.
  \item (3$\times$3 = 9)
    Choose a `good' text window from above, and repeat the analysis with lenses
    which exclude the central words around the neutral point.
    
    The blocked words are $\havgfn \pm \delta \havgfn$
    where $\delta \havgfn = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0,$ and $3.5$.

    By `good', we mean one that seems to you to produce a reasonable smoothing.
    Not too choppy, not too washed out.
    
  \end{enumerate}

  Notes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
    The horizontal axis is ``reading-experience time'' corresponding to 1-grams in the text,
    running from 1 to $N$.
  \item
    The windows should overlap, sliding one word ahead each time.
    This is a simple averaging filter.
  \item
    Points should be located above
    the center of each window.
  \item
    So the point for the window running from
    $n$ to $n+T-1$ ($T$ words) will be located at $n + (T-1)/2$.
  \item
    Do not pre-filter the text for any given lens.
    Windows will contain variable numbers
    of words with and without happiness scores.
  \item
    Only average 1-grams that are in the lexical lens---do not count all possible $T$ words for the normalization. 
  \end{itemize}

  Three example averaging windows for Moby Dick
  with $\delta \havgfn = 2.0$:
